Installing QTM from source
==========================

QTM is built using CMake, a cross-platform build tool.  Although it is still
possible to use qmake, I don't recommend it and am not maintaining the qmake
project file at the moment as there are no translations.  A version of CMake
may be in your operating system's package repositories and installable using
APT, YUM or whatever.  Failing that, you can download it from
http://www.cmake.org/.

You need version 2.4.3 or later.  Note: version 2.4.4 is buggy.  I recommend
getting the most recent version possible; you can get the sources from the
CMake homepage and build the latest version using the version supplied with
your OS.

CMake replaces the "configure" stage which appears with many applications
distibuted as source.

You must also have the common build tools, including the GNU C++ compiler
and GNU Make.  If you are using Ubuntu, type:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential

On other systems, there will be a group of common software development
packages which you may find in the package installation program, such as
Synaptic.

CMake options
-------------

If you do not specify any of these, the defaults will be used.

USE_STI:BOOL - If you are using Qt 4.2 or later, and your desktop includes a system tray -
i.e. a set of icons which you can use to control programs without going
through their main window - you can compile in the QTM system-tray icon. 
This provides much of QTM's distinctive functionality, such as QuickPost and
the templates that go with it.  Default: TRUE (automatically TRUE if
USE_DBUS is TRUE).

USE_DBUS:BOOL - Use the DBus interfaces (these allow other apps to issue
instructions to QTM, which was intended to allow web browsers, RSS readers
etc to post a blog entry based on a web page the user was viewing, but
to my knowledge has never been used for this; it is used for controlling
QTM from the dock menu on Ubuntu Unity). Default: TRUE on X11, FALSE on
Windows and Mac.

QDEBUG:BOOL - If you are a developer and are helping to fix bugs with QTM, set
this option.  This will mean that messages will appear in the terminal
window at certain intervals, a mechanism I use to identify when things go
wrong.  If you just want to use QTM for blogging, do not enable this. On
Windows, this suspends the command prompt if you have one open, and opens
one if you run QTM from Explorer.  Default: FALSE

DESKTOP_ENTRY_PATH:PATH - QTM's build-system generates a file called 
qtm.desktop, which the desktop uses to decide where to put QTM in its menu 
system, such as in KDE and GNOME.  Different systems look for this file in 
different places. Ubuntu, for example, uses /usr/share/applications, while 
Mandriva and PCLinuxOS use /usr/share/applications/kde (at least, if they 
are using KDE).  Default: /usr/share/applications

MANPAGE_DIRECTORY:PATH - This supplies the location of the QTM manual page,
which is displayed when someone types "man qtm" at the Unix command prompt.
This is a rudimentary page, supplied mostly to comply with Debian packaging
guidelines.  Default: /usr/local/share/man/man1 (if compiled to install to
/usr/local)

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH - When you run "make install", this tells your
system where to put QTM.  If you are building a binary package, you should
specify /usr, so that QTM goes to /usr/bin.  Leave this out if installing
it for your own use.  Default: /usr/local (so that qtm will be in 
/usr/local/bin)

DONT_USE_PTE:BOOL - This disables the use of QPlainTextEdit when Qt 4.4 is
present (the class was only introduced with that version of Qt), forcing the
use of QTextEdit for the main editing widget.  This is recommended, as
QPlainTextEdit is buggy.

INSTALL_MARKDOWN:BOOL - Installs Markdown to a "share" location in the file 
system (e.g. /usr/share or /usr/local/share) so that it can be used to 
process text when previewingentries formatted with Markdown. Note that some 
distributions provide a package of Markdown, so you might not need this 
option. Default: FALSE

MARKDOWN_LOCATION:PATH - Only in 0.7.2 or later on Windows and non-Mac Unix
platforms.  This specifies a default location where QTM might find Markdown
(the user can override it); you will normally need to specify this if you
are using a non-Debian Linux platform.  It will not install Markdown to that
location but relies on it being there.  Default: /usr/bin/markdown on Unix
and %APPDIRPATH%/Markdown on Windows.

Qt5:BOOL - Build with Qt 5 if it is present. At the time of writing, the
system tray icon class in Qt does not function in Qt 5 and the function which
sets the menu for the Mac dock icon is not present. So, the app is Qt 5 ready
but Qt 5 itself (still in beta) is not ready yet. Default: FALSE

If building on Windows, you will likely need o set the Makefile generator.
This requires the -G option, followed by the generator name, and if you are
using the standard MinGW compiler kit, this becomes -G "MinGW Makefiles"
(including the quotes).

Configuring
-----------

By this point, I presume you have already unpacked the bundle.  If not, type
this:

tar zxvf qtm-x.x.x.tar.gz
cd qtm-x.x.x.tar.gz

Of course, substitute the numbers for x.x.x.  You may be able to use the
mouse and your desktop's copy and paste features rather than to type the
file's name out.

Then, to configure without any options, type this:

	cmake .

To configure with options, type this:

	cmake -D [option]=[value] .

Do not type the brackets.  So, to configure with the system tray included,
debugging messages off and the desktop spec file at
/usr/share/applications/kde, type this:

	cmake -D USE_STI:BOOL=TRUE .

Remember, as the desktop spec is in /usr/share/applications and debug is off
by default, you don't need to include these options.  You must type -D before
each option.

Also, remember the dot.  It refers to the current directory and tells CMake
to look for a file called CMakeLists.txt there.  CMake will not do anything
if you just type "cmake".

CMake will look for Qt; it will expect to find a file called either qmake or
qmake-qt4 in your search path.  If you have a Unix-type OS, the normal place
for such files is the /usr/bin directory.  Some operating systems are buggy,
however, and do not make sure that qmake is in the search path.  Your
easiest way round this is to find out where qmake is, and add that directory
to the search path.  A likely location is /usr/lib/qt4/bin.  So, to add that
to the search path, type this:

	PATH=/usr/lib/qt4/bin
	export PATH

If the computer is yours, you can also type this, as root or with sudo:

	ln -s /usr/lib/qt4/bin/qmake /usr/bin/qmake-qt4

Building and installing
-----------------------

Now comes the easy bit.  Type this:

	make
	
Then, as root or with sudo:

	make install

And it will install QTM in the /usr/local/bin, unless you have specified
otherwise.
