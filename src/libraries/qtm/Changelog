Changelog:

1.3.15 (1st Jan 2014):

Compatibility: Now compatible with Qt 5.2 on Mac, thanks to a dock icon
menu setter
Compatibility: Always shows a new window on startup on Mac, as a workaround
for a bug in Qt
Qt update: Mac and Windows versions ship with Qt 5.2
Under hood: Uses Wordpress XML-RPC methods to submit entries if the
WP API is enabled. This gets round the irritating bugs caused by posting
content and categories in two or three stages
New feature: Setting entry password (Wordpress blogs only)
Bug fix: Doesn't show the "New window at startup" option if Unity is present,
as there's always a new window at startup under Unity.

1.3.14 (28th Jul 2013):

Bug fix: On Wordpress, publishes post after setting the categories
rather than before (this is to get around a bug in the Social plugin)

1.3.13 (18th Jan 2013):

Bug fix: No longer thinking an entry has been blogged when the attempt
failed (and thus, user can correct the problem and resubmit)
Bug fix: Adds content-type to header when posting (to suppress command
line warnings, although inconsequential)
Compatibility: Qt 5 compatible on Linux, can be made to work on Windows
(not Mac if tray icon/quickpost is compiled).

1.3.12 (16th Oct 2012):

Under hood: Mac global menu now used for the main menu on all
platforms (not the Qt Designer spec)
Bug fix: Crash when opening a new window at startup on the Mac
Bug fix: Crash when opening new window from the tray after closing
a window opened at startup

1.3.11 (11th Oct 2012):

Bug fix: About doesn't disappear when closing all windows on Mac (this
is because the same menu bar is used for all windows on the Mac)
Bug fix: Adds in newlines appropriately when pasting as Markdown block
quote
Bug fix: Shell syntax error in desktop spec generator script
Bug fix: Removed some unused variables that caused compiler warnings
Bug fix: Better positioning when opening a new window from the system
tray icon or Mac dock icon
UI improvement: Now possible to get out of Console by pressing Escape,
as with the entry preview
UI improvement: Ctrl+W now closes a window (#W on Mac)
UI improvement: Shortcuts that used to add and remove Technorati tags
re-assigned to the more commonly used Wordpress-style tags
UI improvement: Ctrl+Z shortcut for Undo, Shift+Ctrl+Z for Redo, as is
normal in GUI editing apps

Mac UI improvement: Preferences dialog now accessible from global menu bar
Mac UI improvement: Added recent-file menu to the Mac no-window menu

1.3.7 (21st February 2012):

Compatibility: Dialog for choosing quickpost templates and recent files
to be called through the Ubuntu Unity launcher.
Bug fix: Now displays recent files at startup on Mac

1.3.6 (3rd January 2012):

Compatibility: removed the Mac unified title & toolbar, as it causes
problems in Cocoa (a Qt bug that also appears in Designer)
Improvement: moved the "Copy URL" button from the status bar into the
side widget, to reduce size of the status bar (esp. on the Mac)
Bug fix: Removed code that links against Carbon (that finds the
Mac bundle directory) and replaced it with Qt code
Bug fix: No longer splits the main from the extended entry when using
Wordpress (as it was causing first two paragraphs to be joined, even if
they were split when the entry was written).
UI Improvement: reduced the size of the margins around some of the controls
on the side panel
UI Improvement: move the "copy URL" button and upload progress bar to the
side panel

detected (to make sure the icon always appears)
New feature: adding a title to an embedded image, and XHTML-friendly
terminated image tags
New feature: Suppress "read more" inserts from newspaper websites
Improvement: less strict HTML entity detection; entity highlighting
now ends with a space or a semicolon. (This is because browsers are
not strict about XML validity, and will display an invalid entity as
plain text, and content management systems will convert ampersands.)

1.3.1 (29th September 2010):

Bug fix: In syntax highlighting, the colour specified for colouring
HTML tags was used as the background for entities at start-up due to
typo

1.3 (7th September 2010):

Qt update: Now requires Qt v4.4

1.2 (3rd Aug 2010):

Bug fix: Values written automatically when selecting a self-hosted blog
type might not have taken
Bug fix: Port settings now honoured

relevant option is enabled (this had been causing posts to de-publish as
a result of wrong times being sent)

1.1.1 (3rd July 2009):

Licensing: Added appropriate GPL header to search widget source files

1.1 (26th June 2009):

New feature: Ability to create categories (in Wordpress blogs only)
New feature: Decodes XML entities such as &amp; in category, blog and
account names
Improvement: Will now run Markdown from the Markdown subdirectory of the
source bundle, whether QTM is built in-source or in a 'build' directory
Bug fix: Now includes [*] placeholder whenever setting the main window title
(to stop console warnings when "setWindowModified" is called)
Bug fix: "Allow trackbacks" setting in accounts form wouldn't keep on second
account down.

1.0 (14th June 2009):

New feature: Support for Wordpress-style tags
User interface: Pressing Esc closes the search widget
User interface: Progress bar, which monitors progress of posting operations
(only, at the moment)
New feature: Save all
Build system: New "confclean" target
Bug fix: About box didn't display version number when invoked from the Mac
supermenu
Bug fix: In Tidy Paste, replace single newlines with single spaces rather
than just removing them
Bug fix: Now fetches the first blog's categories when switching accounts
Bug fix: Now fetches account attributes (allow comments, etc) when starting
up (may have fixed bug where categories were not posted)
Bug fix: Now sets allow comments/trackback boxes in side widget according to
preferences

Bug fix: Fixed typo which was preventing "allow comments" working in the
second account in the list

Bug fix: Removed ampersands from commands in the desktop entry spec files,
and stopped attempts to open filenames consisting solely of an ampersand

0.7.4 (28th Feb 2009):

New feature: "Tidy paste", which allows pasting a selection with multiple
spaces reduced to single spaces, and newlines within paragraphs removed
(both are commonly found in PDFs, and may cause problems with blogging
systems which convert line breaks, although not with normal HTML)

0.7.3.2 (12th Feb 2009):

Bug fix: Sets the default Perl location to the ActivePerl standard install
path on Windows, rather than /usr/bin/perl
Bug fix: Corrected enforcement of UTF-8 encoding for Markdown, so that it
doesn't come out with weird characters instead of apostrophes or UK pound
signs
Bug fix: Disabled "strip paragraph tags" as this feature clashes with some
multi-paragraph tags such as "blockquote"

0.7.3.1 (27th Jan 2009):

Bug fix: Correctly set the default Markdown script location when installing
it to a "share" location

0.7.3 (24th Jan 2009):

New feature: Running Markdown before posting a new entry, with the option to
strip paragraph tags

0.7.2 (20th January 2009):

New feature: Support for Markdown in the Preview window (requires an
external Markdown script)

0.7.1.3 (8th January 2009):

Compatibility: Finally restored Qt 4.1 compatibility by correcting typos in
compile-time isolators, and removing left-over isolators from the accounts
dialog class.

0.7.1.2 (8th January 2009):

Compatibility: Restored Qt 4.1 compatibility by isolating references to
certain widgets which are absent when that version of Qt is used.

Bug fix: Fixed bug which caused the wrong blog ID to be sent out in XML-RPC
requests after changing accounts in certain circumstances

0.7.1 (3rd January 2009):

New feature: Ability to set background and text colours in the editor,
preview and console (requires Qt 4.2 at present)
Improvement: Auto-sets local storage directory if there isn't one
Improvement: Runs the prefs then the accounts for a first-time user if they
click "Yes" in the start-up dialog (and displays "Stage [1/2] of 2" on the
dialog titles)
Improvement: When the category selectors are displayed, searches for
categories if there are already none
Improvement: Sets the status to "dirty" when changing the blogs or 
categories only if there is text in the main entry widget
Improvement: Removed redundant EditingWindow constructor
Improvement: Prepends / to the location field, as webservers require full
paths (e.g. /mt/mt-xmlrpc.cgi or /xmlrpc.php, NOT just xmlrpc.php)
Bug fix: Fixed crash which occurred in the accounts dialog after a new
account was deleted and it was the only account
Bug fix: Corrects start-up behaviour for new users, i.e. stops prompting
them for prefs even after they have specified their preferences
Bug fix: Now auto-refreshes blog list after using accounts dialog when 
there is only one account
Bug fix: Failed to store auto-filled server and location details (esp.
on wordpress.com sites)

0.7 (22nd Oct 2008):

New feature: Ability to specify "no categories" for a post, via a checkbox
in the categories page

Preview/Console" when they are activated, and changed back when deactivated
Bug fix: sorted the "deprecated type conversion" warnings stemming from the
included XPM files
UI improvement: Number of secondary categories displayed next to "Others" in
the heading
Bug fix: displays ampersands in recent file menu properly
Bug fix: stopped adding XML-RPC fault codes to the main account tree

New feature: Multiple accounts
New feature: Assistance to user in filling out account details based on what
CMS or blogging system is being used (in progress)
Build system: Ability to block the use of the QPlainTextEdit widget even if
it is present (as it is buggy)

0.6.3 (7th June 2008):

New feature: recent files menu in both the system tray icon and each window
New feature: two new D-Bus signals, quickpostTemplatesUpdated and
quickpostTemplateTitlesUpdated
Bug fix: use double newlines when pasting text as Blockquotes
Bug fix: strips out extra newlines when pasting text as lists
Bug fix: proportions of the two sides of the quickpost template dialog set
correctly
Build system: now use a CMake configure_file command to generate
qtm_version.h (had not been generating properly on Mac for some reason)
Also, the files account_form.ui and account_form41.ui have been renamed
PrefsForm.ui and PrefsForm41.ui, in preparation for separating the accounts
and preferences dialogs in 0.7

0.6.2.2 (18th May 2008):

Bug fix: now loads categories with saved entries from D-Bus

0.6.2.1 (18th May 2008):

Build system: adds workaround for failure of CMake 2.4 to include and link
the Qt DBus module (causing packages to not build on most recent Linux
distros).

0.6.2 (17th May 2008):

New feature: D-Bus interface, allowing other programs to utilise QTM's
quickpost feature and to open saved or blank documents
Bug fix: "New entry on startup" in the system tray icon works again

0.6.1 (14th May 2008):

New feature: now includes user agent string when making HTTP requests, so
that QTM shows up in web server statistics
Improvement: now uses a QPlainTextEdit on Qt 4.4, rather than the heavier
old QTextEdit, as console and editor widgets
Search widget: can now interact with a QPlainTextEdit as well as an old 
QTextEdit
Build system: building universal binaries no longer the default as it is
really only necessary for distributors, not end users building from source
Build system: version number now inserted into the program dynamically,
using a define in a header built by a shell script/batch file
Bug fix: stopped loading of system-try icon image on the Mac, where it is
not displayed

0.6.0.2 (8th May 2008):

Bug fix: removed "skip rpath" line in the CMake build file, so that it is
possible again to link against sandboxed local installs of Qt.
Bug fix: hid unused widget labelled "Trackback this entry" in the side panel
of the main window

0.6.0.1 (27th April 2008):

Comptibility: restored compatibility with Qt 4.2 by removing Qt 4.3 layout
features.

0.6 (22nd April 2008):

New feature: ability to quickpost articles downloaded through HTTPS as well
as HTTP (requires Qt 4.3, doesn't work on Windows, at least not out of the
box)
User interface: new yellow system-tray icon displayed while quickpost is in
progress (Windows only)
User interface: now displays busy cursors when posting blog entries or
refreshing blog or category lists
Improvement: when setting the title of a new quickpost article, sets the
window title to it as well
Bug fix: now displays categories in proper alphabetical order, with shorter
entries (e.g. KDE) appearing before longer ones (e.g. KDE Apps)
Bug fix: now checks for and, if necessary, creates the local storage
directory before writing the templates file

0.6 beta 1 or 0.5.90 (7th April 2008):

Installer: new Nullsoft Windows installer
New feature: blog lists and categories are saved from session to session
until the blog list is refreshed or the account changed, so that lists
are not refreshed every time a new blog is selected
New feature: can now load entry files from the command line
Compatibility: regex searching in the documents now disabled on Qt 4.1
which doesn't offer the required methods

0.5.8.2 (24th February 2008):

Build system: Enabled out-of-directory builds (patch by Patryk Cisek)
Build system: Now inserts date into manpage automatically, rather than
having to be inserted manually
Bug fix: Category selectors now show categories in proper alphabetical
order, without prioritising uppercase (like abbreviations)
UI improvement: Title field now takes keyboard focus when a fresh window 
is shown

0.5.8.1 (17th February 2008):

Bug fix: The search bar actually stops using expert (i.e. regex-based) Find
when it is disabled through the setExpertEnabled slot (in QTM's case,
through the "Enable expert search preference)

0.5.8 (15th February 2008):

New feature: A search bar, similar to that in Firefox (but actually largely
derived from Qt Assistant)
Bug fix: When loading entries from files, now displays the blog name in the
selector rather than its ID.

0.5.7.1 (10th February 2008):

New feature: Copy title extended to allow non-template quickposts to use
this feature (set in general preferences).  In addition, if this is set, it
becomes the default for the Copy Title option in new QP templates (and the
reverse if it is not).
Unix: Now includes manpage (rudimentary, to satisfy Debian packaging
guidelines).

0.5.7 (7th February 2008):

New feature: "Copy title", allowing the user to automatically name an entry
after the online resource it is based on when quickposting
Improvement: now sorts the categories alphabetically, rather than in the
apparent non-order in which they have previously appeared
Improvement: unedited, fresh Quickposts are no longer "dirty", i.e. if user
tries to close the window, if will not prompt him to save
Removed: accept and reset buttons in the Quickpost Template configuration
dialog; a new template is now "accepted" if any details are entered, while
reset had intractable bugs and can be achieved in any case by cancelling and
reopening the dialog
User interface: added What's This help to the preference item "Save
passwords with entries"

0.5.6.1 (21st October 2007):

Bug fix: bug in associated hosts system, by which empty associated hosts
entries were trapping the // marker in URLs (and thus causing QTM to use the
wrong templates) fixed.

0.5.6 (20th October 2007):

New feature: "associated hosts" in quickpost templates.  The user can
specify a number of hosts in a template, and when he then quickposts an
article with that hostname in the URL, that template will be used.
Improvement: two new template tags: %host% (which is just the hostname of a
page being blogged) and %domain% (which is %host% without the www.).
Bug fix: fixed crashes when shutting the quickpost template config window
when there are no templates.
Build system: fixed relinking behaviour; no longer relinks when QDEBUG is
not set (from CMake command line).

0.5.5 (6th October 2007):

Bug fix: restored compatibility with Qt 4.1 (v0.5.4 had required Qt 4.3, due
to my using Qt Designer 4.3 for designing some widgets)
User interface: Added application icons for menus and the Mac OS X dock
Build system: now uses shell script to generate the X11 desktop entry file
at build time, so that it specifies where exactly the executable and icons
are.

0.5.4 (25th August 2007):

Security: no longer outputs passwords to the console when displaying XML-RPC
listings
New feature: now stores titles and targets for auto links
New feature: ability to clear the console
Improvement: now does base 64 conversions internally, with progress dialog,
rather than the old method of using Qt's built-in converter which blocked
the GUI.
Bug fix: no longer outputs entire encoded file to console when uploading a
file (caused crash)
Bug fix: now detects faults in file upload responses accurately and displays
"406" errors on console as HTML code, not as "displayed" HTML

0.5.4 (beta 2) (1st July 2007):

New feature: Auto link, allowing a certain URL to be associated with a
certain word, so that the author can highlight that word, click Auto link,
and the link to that URL will appear.  (Note: at the moment, it does not
store the title or target.)

0.5.4-beta1 (20th June 2007):

New feature: File upload implemented.  A file can be uploaded, using an
XML-RPC method (metaWeblog.newMediaObject), in Base64 format.  This uses a
blocking base-64 converter which is part of Qt's QByteArray class, and
causes the program to hang while the conversion is going on (noticeable on
large files such as images).

0.5.3 (18th June 2007):

Removed feature: Blogger support.  Blogger no longer supports the APIs that
QTM uses.
New feature: Abort, which stops the current network job (refresh blog or
category list, blog entry posting or whatever)
New features: New variants on Paste: paste as ordered/unordered list, marked
paragraphs (with <p> tags), normal blockquotes and Markdown blockquotes, and
ability to mark up a block as an ordered or unordered list.
New feature: Ability to set whether to submit a date and time or not at
posting time, to avoid clock skews (problem on Wordpress and Textpattern, not
on MT).
New feature: Ability to set the post's remote categories explicitly, through
action "Send categories" in File menu
Build system: Fixed relinking issue at install time, in which (on sandboxed
installs of Qt 4.3.0) the executable was relinked to the normal install of
Qt, even if it was older than 4.3 (causing unresolved symbol errors).
Bug fix: now saves entry numbers when saving entries, so that you can reopen
a posted entry and have QTM post an edit, rather than a new post.
User interface: removed (from view) the unused actions, Print and "Close and
delete".

0.5.2 (20th May 2007):

New feature: Drupal compatibility.  This had always been mentioned in the
documentation, but certain practices, such as identifying blogs and
categories using Movable Type patterns which are not replicated in Drupal,
were preventing Drupal compatibility.  In particular, blogs in MT are the
equivalent of content types in Drupal, and are identified by strings rather
than numbers.
Improvement: now strips whitespaces from titles in Quickposts (Qt 4.2+)
Improvement: now always rebuilds when posting an entry to an MT blog (using
mt.publishPost method)
Qt 4.3: now gives alerts when opening up windows (esp. on Mac, where the
icon bounces)
Bug fix: when quitting, looks for QTM main windows specifically, rather than
visible widgets in general (this was preventing quitting on Qt 4.3)
Build system: Mac users can specify non-universality with a CMake option,
rather than by commenting out a line in CMakeLists.txt
Build system: Location of desktop spec file (qtm.desktop) can be specified
at configure time; category list now includes
X-MandrivaLinux-Internet-Other
Bug fix: menu entry to view TB ping list now works (also has Ctrl+5
shortcut)

0.5.1.2 (8th May 2007):

Bug fix: fixed a crash which happened when processing XML-RPC responses to
category requests to blogs which have no categories - such as Drupal content
types with no taxonomies.  This makes for Drupal compatibility.

0.5.1.1 (7th May 2007):

Bug fix: fixed a crash which happened when doing a templateless quickpost. 
This was caused by trying to fetch the default publish status for a
non-existent template.

0.5.1 (6th May 2007):

User interface: the system-tray icon no longer displays on the Mac. 
Instead, the same menu is displayed by double-clicking on the dock icon.  A
bare-bones default main menu, with New, Open and Quit functions (the latter
displayed in the dock and application menus), appears when there is no
top-level window present on the Mac (only on Qt 4.2; this may change in
future releases).
User interface: the Abort Quick Post action in the STI menu appears (albeit
greyed out) even when it is disabled; this is to get round a bug in Qt on
the Mac
New feature: the user can now reset changes made to quickpost templates
before closing the dialog (Qt 4.2 only)
New feature: option to "treat posting as saving" - in other words, when this
is on, if you write a post and post it (draft or publish) and then try to
close the window, QTM will not ask you if you want to save it.
New feature: in Quickpost Templates (Qt 4.2), to set whether posts written 
using a given template should be draft or publish (or simply to use the 
default setting)
New feature: qtm.desktop file, which provides a KDE/GNOME menu entry on
platforms which support it

0.5.0.1 (12th April 2007):

Bug fix: All qDebugs (causing console output) commented out and use of the
macro QT_NO_DEBUG_OUTPUT stopped (this caused compile failure on Debian
Etch, which uses Qt 4.2.1)
Bug fix: the Qt Designer file for the main window (CatkinMainWindow.ui) now
has a new version (CatkinMainWindow41.ui) for Qt 4.1.

0.5 (25th March 2007):

Bug fix: Quit now works (from system-tray icon and File menu) on Windows
(tested on XP only)
Improvement: Newlines now stripped from title of a quickposted article (some
websites have newlines in their page titles, eg. telegraph.co.uk)
Bug fix: Various memory leaks (dialogs undeleted) fixed

0.5 RC1 (19th March 2007):

User interface: New keyboard shortcuts for new, open and save in File menu,
and Mac standard Ctrl+comma for preferences is now present on all platforms
Bug fix: App now has Quit action in the main application menu, and the quit
actions there and in the STI actually work (as they didn't in the beta)
Bug fix: Removed a few more references to Catkin QTM
Bug fix: Debug-related console output stopped, unless debug is specifically
enabled at CMake stage

0.5-beta1 (10th March 2007):

The app is now called QTM throughout, rather than Catkin QTM (a remnant of
the old Catkin client for Blosxom), except in the internal application name,
which is maintained so that it finds config files correctly
New feature: Quickpost templates, which can be set-up and used through the
system tray icon (req. Qt 4.2)
New feature: The user can send trackback pings from QTM (4.1 & 4.2)
Bug fix: App crashed after closing prefs dialog when system tray icon was in
use (4.2)
Bug fix: Now shuts down when the Quit option is chosen from the STI on the
Mac (so the STI is now viable on the Mac) (4.2)

0.4 (14th January 2007):

New feature: Quickpost, the ability to use the system-tray icon to post the
contents of the clipboard or, on X11, the mouse selection. (Qt 4.2 only)
User interface: the "round" icon (susesystray.xpm), introduced for SUSE 10.2 
binary in 0.3.10, is now standard on X11.
Bug fix: Program no longer sporadically echoes various debugging information
to the console (achieved by commenting out all qDebug lines)

0.3.10 (12th December 2006):

Bug fix: the warning message which was being displayed while requesting
missing passwords for entries loaded from files is now gone.
Build change: the useSTI.h header file is gone; to compile with the system
tray icon (recommended on KDE/GNOME, absolutely not on Mac OS X), build as
follows: cmake -D USE_STI:BOOL=TRUE . (the dot is necessary and represents
the current directory).  Otherwise, cmake . as before.

0.3.10-beta1 (12th November 2006):

QTM can now post to Blogger blogs (however, the posts have to be *displayed*
from within the Blogger web interface; this is a problem at Blogger's end
and affects other similar applications).
Added system tray icon which can presently start a new entry, open a saved
one and quit the application.  This is supported by Qt 4.2 only and can be
activated, or de-activated, by editing the file useSTI.h.  Not recommended
for use on Windows and Mac OS X.
Fonts for editing, previewing and the console now set using Qt 4.2 font
combos when built on a system with Qt 4.2.
Now possible to set the console font (from the Edit menu on Qt 4.1, from the
prefs dialog on 4.2)
Redesigned the preferences dialog on 4.2 (the old one, albeit with new
options, is present on 4.1)
User can now set whether to allow comments and TBs by default in the prefs
window
Bug fix: fixed crash when occurred when the program attempted to access
non-existent web servers or services.

0.3.9.1 (2nd September 2006):
Bug fix: fixed signal-slot mismatch which was preventing the host lookup
added in 0.3.9 being acted upon.  (Note: there are still some ways of making
the app crash by getting it to post to non-existent web servers or services. 
I intend to fix this in the forthcoming 0.3.10 release.)
(3rd Sept) Included CMakeLists.txt file for building QTM using CMake.

0.3.9 (24th August 2006):
The application now uses DOM to generate all submissions to the web service,
in order to make proper encoding more reliable.
Bug fix: the application now stops when the web service is not found or
refuses access (eg. due to the user supplying the wrong password).  This had
been the cause of crashes in the past.

0.3.8.2 (7th August 2006):
Bug fix: removed line which was causing the previewer, not the editor, to
appear when starting up
Bug fix: preventing switching from console to previewer and vice versa, as
it was impossible to switch back to the editor.  One can now only enact
either the previewer or the console from the editor.

0.3.8.1 (6th August 2006):
Bug fix: blocked network actions when app starts up with no account details
(to block routes to crash bug otherwise fixed in 0.3.8).

0.3.8 (6th August 2006):
Feature: added the ability to forget account details with one click of a
push button.
Bug fix: when there are no account details present, all routes to network
access are now blocked.  This is because they caused the program to crash
(such as when the user deleted his account details by hand and then closed
the preferences dialog; the program would try to refresh the blog and
category lists, causing the crash).

0.3.7 (3rd July 2006):
Feature: directory browse button in the preferences dialog enabled
Feature: possible to use right mouse button in the location space in the
prefs dialog to insert custom filenames mt-xmlrpc.cgi and xmlrpc.php (common
XML-RPC receivers)

Improvement: QTM now prompts for a password when loading an entry saved
without one (and then sets the categories properly)

location are the same after the preferences dialog has been used
Feature: new toolbar button to mark a block of text as blockquote

0.3.5 (13th June 2006):
Bug fix: QTM now changes tildes in the drafts directory to the actual path of the

dialog
